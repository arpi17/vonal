# Vonal
A fullstack web app that lets users create and discover routes around the world. Built with the MERN stack and the Mapbox API. The drawing functionality was inspired by [this](https://blog.mapbox.com/map-hacks-directions-api-draw-tools-7557134622e9) blogpost

## Notes
Currently this application is in testing mode only. Currently it lacks many feaures I'd like to build in the future however it is a functional demo app that is intended to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development
